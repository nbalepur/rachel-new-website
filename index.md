I am a fifth year PhD student in the Center for Language and Speech Processing
at Johns Hopkins University, advised by
[Benjamin Van Durme](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/).
My research focuses on problems in natural language understanding, including
knowledge acquisition from text, commonsense inference,
computationally-tractable semantic representations, and semantic parsing.
Before coming to JHU, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Yale
University, where I worked with Dana Angluin and Bob Frank.
                                                                                
My work is generously supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program.
