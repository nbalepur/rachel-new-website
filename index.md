Starting Fall 2020, I will be an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the
University of Maryland, College Park.
During 2019-2020, I am a [Young Investigator](https://allenai.org/young-investigators.html)
for the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) in Seattle, WA.

I recently defended my PhD at Johns Hopkins University, in the Center for Language
and Speech Processing (CLSP), advised by [Benjamin Van Durme](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/).
My research focuses on problems in natural language understanding, including
knowledge acquisition from text, commonsense inference,
computationally-tractable semantic representations, and semantic parsing.
I am also a contributing member of the [Decompositional Semantics Initiative](http://decomp.io).
Previously, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Yale
University, where I worked with Dana Angluin and Bob Frank.
